# agra
Algebraic Geometry for Regions of Attraction

AGRA is a simple Matlab tool to compute maximum level of a given polynomial Lyapunov function for a given polynomial system via enumeration of all local minima (yes, as terrible as it sounds !). It uses numerical algebraic geometry package PHCpack, available at http://homepages.math.uic.edu/~jan/download.html.

Please copy phc executable and its Matlab interface PHClab into the directory with AGRA files. See and run good_examples.m, bad_examples.m and gui_example.m to understand how to use AGRA.

Matlab version: 2013b or later.
